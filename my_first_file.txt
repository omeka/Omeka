=========================
Don't be afraid to commit
=========================

A hands-on workshop for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute
more to the projects they use, but need more grounding in some of the tools
required.

What's in it for you
====================

As well as helping to put you in a position to commit successfully to
collaborative projects, the workshop's emphasis on using virtualenv/pip and
git will help you manage your own work in a more streamlined and efficient
way.

What we'll cover
================

The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying a simple issue in a
Django or Python project, writing a patch with documentation, and submitting it.

The workshop will take you through the use of:

* virtualenv and pip
* git (and GitHub)
* writing and building documentation using Sphinx
* submitting a pull request

A workbook and reference guide will be provided to support the workshop.

What you need to know
=====================

The workshop is open to anyone, but places will be limited.
