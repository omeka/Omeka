<h3><a id="personally" class="namedanchor">I wasn&#8217;t personally affected by Hurricane Katrina. Should I still contribute my story, image or other file?</a></h3>
<p>Yes! We want to hear from you. In addition to the stories of those who were directly impacted by Hurricane Katrina, we are interested in hearing about the experiences of members of regional Jewish communities who helped settle and care for evacuees, and individuals and organizations across the country who participated in relief efforts.</p>
<p>We are also interested in your memories of the community before Hurricane Katrina struck, as well as your thoughts and hopes for the future. </p>
<p>Your contributions may be of any length. </p>

<h3><a id="multiple-stories" class="namedanchor">I would like to contribute multiple stories, images or other files to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices. Do I have to upload them one by one?</a></h3>
<p>If you are only submitting a few items, we ask that you upload them one by one through our online interface Just click on &#8220;Add Your Voice&#8221; to access the contribution form. You will only be asked to complete the background questions one time. If, however, you would like to submit more than 20 objects, you may contact us at katrina@jwa.org to make special arrangements for your contribution.</p>

<h3><a id="guidelines" class="namedanchor">Are there any special guidelines for uploading images?</a></h3>
<p>Images and other files larger than 5MB may not be uploaded through the website interface. However, if you would like to contribute files larger than 5MB, please email us at katrina@jwa.org to make special arrangements.</p>

<h3><a id="tagging" class="namedanchor">What is a tag? How do I use them?</a></h3>
<p>Tagging is a freeform way to categorize objects that helps people search across online collections more efficiently. A tag can refer to a general category or description (such as &#8220;Biloxi&#8221; or &#8220;synagogue&#8221;), or to a concept (like &#8220;hope&#8221; or &#8220;evacuation&#8221;), or it can be more personal (such as &#8220;Sanford Cohen&#8221;). </p>
<p>You can tag the objects you submit to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices with as many, or as few, tags as seem useful to you. A tag on this site can contain more than one word (for example, &#8220;Beth Israel Congregation&#8221; or &#8220;Lakeview District&#8221;). Multiple tags are separated by commas. You can facilitate the process of finding objects contributed by other members of your community or family by assigning common tags, such as &#8220;Touro Synagogue&#8221; or &#8220;Wise Family.&#8221; </p>
<p>You can see what tags other people are using by exploring our &#8220;tag cloud&#8221; graphic, or by looking at the tags listed as part of each object&#8217;s description. When you click on a tag in the &#8220;tag cloud,&#8221; you will be taken to a page from which you can browse all objects that share that tag. You can also put tags in the search box and use them as part of your search.</p>
<p>You can add, delete, or edit the tags that you have assigned to any object you have contributed whenever you are logged in to this website. You may also add tags to another person&#8217;s contributions (although you can&#8217;t delete or edit tags others have contributed). If you feel that someone else&#8217;s tag is inappropriate or inaccurate, you may contact us at katrina@jwa.org.</p>

<h3><a id="womenandmen" class="namedanchor">I thought <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> only collects women&#8217;s stories. Is that true for this collection?</a></h3>

<h3><a id="public1" class="namedanchor">Do I have to make my contribution available to the public?</a></h3>

<h3><a id="notappearing" class="namedanchor">I recently contributed a story, image or other file to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices. Why doesn&#8217;t it appear on the website?</a></h3>
<p>Each contribution submitted to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices is evaluated and processed by <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> staff. Thus it may take some time between when you submitted your contribution and when it appears on the website. </p>
<p>Moreover, sometimes <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> staff determines&mdash;or you indicate on the consent form&mdash;that you lack the necessary ownership rights in an object to release it. In such cases, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> may contact you, and/or the copyright holder, for further information.</p>

<h3><a class="namedanchor" id="citations">How do I cite materials on the Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices website?</a></h3>
<p>Please use the following format to cite materials on the Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices website: Author. Title, &lt;URL&gt; in &#8220;Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices: An Online Collecting Project of the Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive&#8221; (today&#8217;s date).</p> 
<p>For example: Loewy, Rabbi Robert H., &#8220;Katrina and Our Jewish Values,&#8221; &lt;http://katrina.jwa.org&gt;, in &#8220;Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices: An Online Collecting Project of the Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive (June 6, 2006).</p>

<h3><a  class="namedanchor" id="authenticity">How do I know that the contents of Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices are authentic and factually accurate?</a></h3>
<p>Most people who make the effort to submit an object to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices share the goal of its organizers&mdash;that is, to create a reliable and permanent record about the Jewish communities of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and of the Jewish community&#8217;s experiences of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath&mdash;and therefore most contributions are authentic.</p>
<p>That said, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> cannot vouch for the factual accuracy of any individual contribution. We do know, however, that every submission to Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices Ð even those that prove to be erroneous, misleading, or dubious Ð can contribute in some way to the historical record. A misleading individual account, for example, could reveal certain personal and emotional aspects of the event that would otherwise be lost in a strict authentication and appraisal process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as with any historical sources (including, for example, newspaper accounts), there are always questions about reliability, and all researchers need to evaluate their sources critically. It is for this reason that Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices requests information from every contributor&mdash;including name, email address, location, zip code, gender, age, occupation, and date received. As part of its evaluation process for each submission, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> verifies that the contributor exists at the email s/he lists. We also urge researchers to examine the metadata in relation to one another, in relation to the content of the submission, and in relation to other authenticated records. Sound research technique is the basis of sound scholarship. Researchers with particular concerns should contact katrina@jwa.org for more information.</p>
